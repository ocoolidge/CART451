		"content": "                Volumes in the entry-level car segment are slipping as prices have surged on regulatory requirements around safety and emissions, and higher cost of inputs.      \n                                                      October 30, 2022 / 10:54 AM IST                                                        \n               Maruti Suzuki India (File image)          With the hatchbacks, especially in the entry-level segment, seeing lukewarm sales this financial year compared to the pre-COVID times, Maruti Suzuki India Limited (MSIL) affirmed that going forward it will be sharpening its focus on Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) across segments than towards small cars run on internal combustion engines (ICE). Besides, it will launch the Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) variants of some of the existing petrol-driven models.“In the second quarter (of this FY), hatchbacks have shown growth, but that is limited to the festival season. I don’t see this segment’s growth continuing subsequent to this quarter and early next year. This simply means the ability of people, whether in urban or rural areas, to buy hatchbacks has eroded. By next year, there will be a degrowth in the hatchback segment,” R.C. Bhargava, Chairman, MSIL, said post Q2 FY2022-23 results announcement.The country’s largest passenger vehicle-maker stated that sales of entry-level cars will continue to degrow as consumers’ disposable income has reduced due to higher prices and inflationary pressures. However, it must be mentioned that this phenomenon does not seem to have adversely impacted the spending power of buyers who are aiming at SUVs.Its overall market share, which was at 51 per cent in FY2019, has gone down to 41 per cent during this September quarter.“The small car segment has been declining (since FY2018-19) and has lost around 26-28 percent of numbers during this period,” added Bhargava.Maruti Suzuki also acknowledged that volumes in the entry-level car segment are declining as prices have surged due to regulatory requirements around safety and emissions and higher cost of inputs. When asked how the company is planning to re-engineer its small cars in order to comply with safety norms, he maintained that the auto industry body has been discussing this matter with the government.“The industry is taking up this question as to what would be a realistic date of not only implementation of six airbags, but also of installing the three-point seat belts at the rear seats,” stated the chairman of MSIL.Meanwhile, MSIL on Friday reported a rise of 334 percent year-on-year (YoY) in standalone net profit at Rs 2,061 crore in Q2 FY23 on the back of record volumes of its newly-launched SUVs, Grand Vitara, and Brezza, during the quarter.“Compared to the earlier composition, there will be a higher percentage of sales in the upper end of the market compared to the lower end and we will be adapting our product portfolio accordingly,” added Bhargava. However, he didn’t share what kind of models will be introduced. He was also categorical that MSIL had no plans to phase out any small cars from its product portfolio.MSIL has garnered 75,000 units of confirmed bookings for the Grand Vitara, of which a little over a third (25,500 units) is from strong hybrid variants. So, out of pending orders of 60,000 units, 20,100 units is for the strong hybrid variant (about 34 percent).“Aggressive product strategy and heightened focus on the SUV segment will undoubtedly help Maruti Suzuki make a strong comeback and regain its lost market share. We have seen in the past too, its ability to understand the market and consumers is unparalleled, and the company has always bounced back with more power and emerged as a winner,” said Puneet Gupta of S&P Automotive.MSIL, meanwhile, has not given up on the challenge of hitting the two-million sales mark.“The major determinant of our ability to succeed is semiconductor availability. There is a constraint of semiconductors, fundamentally from one company. And that is affecting four of our models,\" revealed Bhargava.Bhargava did not concur with the industry perception that Maruti Suzuki is late in foraying into the electric passenger vehicle segment (slated for 2025 roll-out).\"We are localizing the components, looking at the infrastructure development in the country. An electric vehicle customer should not face issues,\" he said.\n     \n         \n                \n     \n\n                            ",

		"content": "\n\nA view of a giant display of stock indexes, following the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in Shanghai, China, October 24, 2022. \nA turbulent stock market and easy monetary conditions have made bond funds in mainland China the most preferred investment this year, and possibly the best-performing asset in the region.Chinese public bond funds' total assets under management (AUM) grew 27% from January to September to a record high of 5.19 trillion yuan ($717.07 billion), data from the Asset Management Association of China (AMAC) showed. That was the fastest growth among the five asset classes tracked by AMAC.Shanghai-based Colight Asset Management, one of the largest private bond funds in mainland China, saw its AUM expand by about 60% this year, reaching 20 billion yuan.Falling domestic interest rates and anxiety about economic growth have driven local investors into China's relatively stable bond markets, fund managers said, with the bearishness on stock prices and earnings exacerbating the trend.\"I have to say it's the poor performance of other assets that makes bond funds stand out,\" said Jianqiao Feng, general manager of Colight Asset Management.Seeking to make the most of this trend, Blackrock Inc <BLK.N> launched its first bond-oriented fund in China on Nov. 1. The fund invests primarily in fixed income, with a less than 30% equity exposure.China has been an outlier this year as major central banks raised interest rates rapidly to fight inflation. The People's Bank of China kicked off its easing cycle in December 2021 and cut its benchmark interest rates twice in 2022, thus propping up bond prices.Meanwhile equities, traditionally popular among investors, have offered dismal returns because of negative factors such as simmering U.S.-China tensions, as well as China's frequent COVID-19 lockdowns and property crisis. The CSI 300 Index has tumbled more than 20% this year, while the yuan is down 12% versus the U.S dollar.In the six months to October, China's onshore bond funds saw inflows of $73 billion, while equity funds faced outflows of $12.6 billion, according to Refinitiv data.\"Given the sharp correction of equity funds since the beginning of the year and the lowered return of currency funds, investors have shifted to low- and medium-risk fixed-income products,\" said Jinlong He, chairman of Youmeili Investment, a multi-asset manager based in Shenzhen.The investment strategy has paid off.Domestic bond funds' average return rose 9.74% in the first nine months of the year, according to fund distributor Simuwang.com, which tracks more than 18,000 onshore private funds, far outperforming other investment strategies. Equity funds were the worst hit, falling 12.8%.Sales of short-term bonds that mature within a year have boomed, with assets at domestic short-term bond funds up 85% this year.Shenzhen-based Penghua Fund Management announced last week it had raised 1.58 billion yuan in its new medium-to-short term bond fund.Investments in short-term bonds this year could generate a relatively higher return than those in currency bonds and bank deposit rates, Youmeili's He said, while also providing liquidity. This has made short-term bond investment one of the most popular strategies in 2022, he said.Colight's Feng said most of the inflows the fund has seen this year has gone into its Tonghui No.1 Fund, which focuses on fixed rate bonds and low risk corporate bonds, with an average portfolio duration of 1.86 years and no leverage.Graphic: Money flows into Chinese bond and equity funds -The challenge for such bond investors is that China is loath to cut rates further, out of concern for the weakening yuan.\"We advise our clients to lower their return expectations and look for certainty, everyone should accept this reality,\" Feng said.($1 = 7.2378 Chinese yuan renminbi)© Copyright Thomson Reuters 2022.

The move will help PSU lenders retain talent.\n\n\"A whole-time director, including the managing director, shall devote his whole time to the affairs of the nationalised bank and shall hold office for such a initial term not exceeding five years and extendable up to a total period, including the initial term, not exceeding 10 years, as the central government may, after consultation with the Reserve Bank, specify and shall be eligible for re-appointment,\" the notification read.\n\nPresently, many whole-time directors of PSU banks entered the board at a young age. The amendment would benefit them.\n\nIn the meantime, global brokerage BofA Securities has also issued a report saying that the turnaround in PSU bank stocks has legs beyond the largest lender . It expects the valuation discount between PSU banks and private sector banks to narrow further.\n\n\"Indian PSBs have been on the path of normalisation over the past few years, and it all came together in Q2, to deliver the best RoA in the past eight years. PSB's loan/PPOP growth was almost at par with private banks,\" BofA analyst Anand Swaminathan said, adding that the most comforting factor was the broad-based improvement in asset quality metrics.\n\n\n(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

Earlier this month, those gains began to reverse, as some investors seemed to decide to take profits from the sector’s top year-to-date performers. Despite those jitters, however, there is still opportunity in the healthcare sector.\n\n In an effort to identify the healthcare stocks that Wall Street analysts believe have the most room to grow, we screened the \n\n          \n            Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund\n (ticker: XLV), an exchange-traded fund that tracks larger healthcare stocks, for the stocks that trade the farthest below their average analyst price targets, as calculated by FactSet. The XLV is down 5.4% this year as of Monday’s close, its constituents split rather cleanly between stocks that are trailing the \n\n        \n          \n            S&P 500\n          \n so far this year, and stocks that are beating the S&P 500. We limited our screen to larger-cap names with market values of more than $20 billion. To ensure that the mean target prices represented a robust range of opinions, we also limited our screen to companies for which FactSet’s average included the estimates of at least 10 analysts. These target prices are just guesses; what’s more, they can mean different things to different analysts. Still, the average target price gives investors a sense of where Wall Street, by and large, thinks a stock could be going. The stocks that passed the screen represent not the year’s healthcare highfliers, but the stocks in the sector that have largely underperformed the S&P 500, which is down more than 15% this year through Monday.\n\n        Company / TickerRecent priceMean target priceImplied potential upsideYTD changeZoetis / ZTS$146.45$212.8045.3%-40.0%Edwards Lifesciences / EW$73.51$92.5125.8%-43.3Centene / CNC$82.04$101.2123.4%-0.4Medtronic / MDT$82.90$101.3822.3%-19.9CVS Health / CVS$97.17$116.7420.1%-5.8Baxter International / BAX$53.68$64.0019.2%-37.5 Source: Factset \n They include the animal-health firm \n\n        \n          \n            Zoetis \n          \n(ZTS), down 40% this year, which trades at a 45% discount to its mean target price of $212.80. \n\n        \n          \n            Zoetis\n          \n shares climbed sharply throughout the pandemic, jumping more than 80% between the end of 2019 and the end of 2021. This year, the stock has given away a good chunk of those gains. In a note out early in November, William Blair analyst Brandon Vazquez wrote that the company sees a strong demand for pets, despite the broader economic environment. “Despite noise in the quarter, management was clear that there has not been a slowdown in companion animal demand, and it expects this segment can remain resilient even in difficult macroeconomic conditions,” Vazquez wrote. Another stock that passed the screen was \n\n        \n          \n            Edwards Lifesciences\n          \n (EW), which makes heart valves, among other products. Its shares have fallen 43% this year. The stock has an average analyst target price of $92.51, about 26% above its recent price of $73.51. Edwards shares fell 15.4% in a single day in late October, after the company reported earnings that included disappointing sales results for its transcatheter aortic valve replacement device. Since then, the company has bought back shares. The health insurer \n\n        \n          \n            Centene \n          \n(CNC), down 0.4% this year, also passed the screen; its stock trades about 23% below its mean target price. So did \n\n        \n          \n            Medtronic \n          \n(MDT), the medical device firm; is shares have tumbled about 20% this year, and trade 22% below the mean target price. \n\n        \n          \n            Baxter International \n          \n(BAX), which sells dialysis machines and other devices to treat kidney conditions, among other products, is down about 38% this year. The stock trades at some 19% below its mean target price of $64. Write to Josh Nathan-Kazis at josh.nathan-kazis@barrons.com \n\n\n\n",

		"content": "\nAlways look on the bright side. Not only does this put you in a better mood, but it also can help you make money. That's especially true in the current stock market downturn.\nWe asked three Motley Fool contributors to pick beaten-down stocks to buy right now. Here's why they chose Moderna (MRNA 0.48%), Pfizer (PFE -0.33%), and Zoetis (ZTS 0.50%).\nLook beyond the pandemic\nProsper Junior Bakiny (Moderna): The market is forward-looking. Right now, it sees trouble ahead for companies that rely partly or exclusively on their coronavirus vaccines or medicines to generate revenue. Moderna fits the bill, which is why its shares have dropped substantially this year. Starting in 2023, the company's sales will suffer. To be clear, though, Moderna's revenue won't drop to zero as COVID-19 is almost definitely here to stay. \nThe biotech has one of the most successful vaccines on the market, and it has targeted variants of the coronavirus with newer versions of its crown jewel. Moderna will remain a leader in the coronavirus booster market.\nEqually as important, though, investors should try to look beyond next year. Moderna is generating lots of cash thanks to its coronavirus portfolio; it had $17 billion in cash and equivalents as of Sept. 30. That will allow it to advance its pipeline programs. \n\nThe company has well over a dozen non-COVID candidates, including three that have reached late-stage studies: potential vaccines for flu, cytomegalovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus. Moderna's messenger RNA (mRNA) approach has an advantage because vaccines of this type tend to be faster to manufacture.  \nAlthough we shouldn't expect Moderna to be as fast to launch its next products on the market as it was during the COVID outbreak, the company looks set to record important clinical and regulatory wins in the next five years. It should also continue to advance its ambitious early-stage programs such as its vaccines for HIV and vaccines that target various cancers.\nWill the company's programs always pan out? Probably not. But with a diverse pipeline and the funds to carry them to approval, Moderna's future still looks bright, despite its poor performance on the stock market this year. \nA big margin of safety\nDavid Jagielski (Pfizer): Having a good margin of safety is something you'll often hear billionaire investors Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger talk about. It's all about giving yourself a buffer between where an investment is valued today versus where you think it ought to be. Pfizer stands out as one stock that I think has a potentially significant buffer.\nShares of this top healthcare company are down close to 20% this year and trade at just nine times trailing earnings. By comparison, the average healthcare stock trades at a multiple of nearly 22. There's a huge buffer there to suggest that even if Pfizer's earnings were to be cut in half, it could still be a good buy.\n\nInvestors are clearly bracing for a sharp decline in revenue. With COVID-19 revenue totaling $56 billion and accounting for over half of Pfizer's business this year, a drop-off could be likely as people become less concerned about the coronavirus.\nBut that's a big assumption since there are concerns that COVID cases could spike this winter. The U.S. government is also looking at whether Pfizer's pill Paxlovid could be an effective treatment for long COVID.\nEven if there's a drop-off, it likely won't be as steep as what investors are pricing into the stock's valuation right now. And Pfizer hasn't been sitting idle. It has been making moves to acquire businesses that can improve its long-term potential, including the recent acquisitions of Global Blood Therapeutics (for sickle cell treatment) and Biohaven Pharmaceuticals (migraine therapy).\nPfizer's business is facing some challenges: It will undoubtedly lose some revenue from COVID treatments and products that are losing exclusivity later this decade. But the bearishness surrounding the stock seems to be excessive. This is a company that quickly formulated a coronavirus vaccine, proving how fast it can adapt to change and bring a product to market.\nInvestors shouldn't dismiss the company's track record for growth. Although there's some risk ahead for the business, there's also plenty of margin of safety at its current valuation to make Pfizer a good stock to buy right now.\nA global leader with bright long-term prospects\nKeith Speights (Zoetis): It's been an especially rough year for Zoetis. Shares of the animal health company have plunged more than 40%. It has faced several headwinds, including supply chain issues, staffing challenges in veterinarians' offices, and the strong U.S. dollar.\n\nBut the long-term prospects for Zoetis remain bright. More than 60% of the company's total revenue comes from products for companion animals. This market should expand significantly as more people adopt pets and spend on the animals' health. \nZoetis' livestock business should also be a solid growth opportunity. The demand for protein in emerging markets, notably China, appears likely to increase as overall income levels grow. \nNo company is in as strong a position to profit from these trends as Zoetis. It currently ranks as the global market leader in animal health for companion animals, cattle, fish, and swine. And it is No. 5 worldwide in the poultry market.\nThe company has delivered market-beating revenue growth in recent years. CEO Kristin Peck said in the third-quarter conference call that Zoetis has \"the pipeline, market leadership positions, global scale, and financial strength to continue outpacing the market.\"\nI think she's right. Wall Street seems to believe so, too: The consensus 12-month price target reflects an upside potential of more than 50% for this beaten-down stock.\n\nDavid Jagielski has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Keith Speights has positions in Pfizer. Prosper Junior Bakiny has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Zoetis. The Motley Fool recommends Moderna Inc. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.\n",

		"content": "\nWhile the stock market may have taken investors for a wild ride over the past year, the trajectory of innovation isn't slowing down. With that comes abundant opportunity for long-term-minded investors with a buy-and-hold strategy to consistently invest in great companies -- even in a down market.\nHere are three revolutionary stocks you may want to consider scooping up before 2022 is out. \n1. Vertex Pharmaceuticals \nVertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX 0.19%) is something of a unicorn in the world of stocks right now. While the S&P 500 has slid by nearly 20% over the past 12 months, Vertex is up by around 60% in that same period. While it's true that healthcare stocks tend to outperform when the market is down, this is far from the only tailwind driving Vertex's precipitous growth in such a volatile market. \nThe company's core lineup of products -- all of which treat the genetic disease cystic fibrosis -- face consistently high, non-cyclical demand. That's true as well for its current pipeline, which includes candidates addressing everything from diabetes to sickle cell disease. Vertex's suite of cystic fibrosis drugs are the only approved CFTR modulators on the market, which means they target the defective protein that causes someone to develop cystic fibrosis. \n\nThere are 105,000 people globally with cystic fibrosis, and 1,000 are diagnosed with the disease in just the U.S. each year. Vertex's best-known cystic fibrosis drug, Trikafta, is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat more than 90% of all individuals who have the disease. So it's fair to say that the company's market footprint is massive and growing. Over the past decade, Vertex's revenue has risen by more than 200% while its bottom line has increased by nearly 800% in that same period.  \nAnalysts currently estimate that Vertex shares could have a potential upside of 46% on the high end over the next year alone.  \n2. Intuitive Surgical \nWhereas the previous pick has a unique competitive edge in the world of biotech stocks, Intuitive Surgical (ISRG -0.82%) controls more than three-quarters of the surgical robotics market. This is an area that analysts estimate will attain a valuation of about $21 billion by 2030.  \nIntuitive Surgical's best-known product is the da Vinci surgical robotics system system used in millions of minimally invasive surgeries all over the world. To give you an idea of the company's vast footprint, the global surgical robotics market hit an estimated valuation of about $5.2 billion in 2021. Last year, Intuitive Surgical's total annual revenue from its systems, instruments, and accessories totaled about $4.8 billion.  \n\nOver the past 10 years, Intuitive Surgical's annual revenue and net income have risen by around 160% annually -- and the stock has delivered a total return of more than 300% for investors. While a decline in procedures due to COVID-19 recurrence in certain markets has impacted recent financial reports, Intuitive Surgical continues to grow its top line and remain profitable.  \nIt's no wonder analysts think the stock could achieve a high upside of 36% over the next 12 months.  \n3. Pfizer \nPfizer (PFE -0.33%) has seen eye-popping top- and bottom-line growth recently due to the blockbuster success of its vaccine and antiviral medication for COVID-19. In fact, the company estimates that these two products alone could deliver total sales of $56 billion in 2022. In 2021, these products generated sales of nearly $38 billion, with the lion's share of that coming from Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty.  \nNow, with the company sitting on mounds of cash on hand and an already diverse portfolio of products, investors might wonder what the future holds for this top healthcare stock.\nIf the company's recent torrent of acquisitions is any indication, this could be just the beginning of a new season of growth for the 173-year-old pharmaceutical giant. The acquisitions have been spanning a wide range of disease areas, including dermatology, cardiology, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections, and migraines. \n\nAs coronavirus product sales inevitably slow, these new products can generate sustained, long-term momentum for the company. This is on top of Pfizer's core portfolio of top-selling medicines like blood thinner Eliquis and cardiomyopathy drugs Vyndaqel/Vyndamax -- which together raked in combined sales of about $2.1 billion during the most recent quarter.\nPfizer has long been an established presence with a strong track record of successes well before the pandemic occurred. Over the trailing 10-year period, its annual revenue and net income have both risen by around 50%. Its dividend, which currently yields 3.4% for investors, has risen by 25% over the past five years. \nAnalysts are currently estimating that Pfizer could have a high potential upside of around 60% over the upcoming 12 months.  \n\nRachel Warren has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Intuitive Surgical and Vertex Pharmaceuticals. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.\n",

		"content": "Indian markets closed in the green for the sixth consecutive day on Tuesday tracking positive cues.\n\nS&P BSE Sensex rallied 177 points while Nifty50 closed above 18,600 levels.\n\nStocks that were in focus include names like  which was up over 5%,  which gained nearly 3%, and  which hit a fresh 52-week high to close with gains of over 2% on Tuesday.\n\n\nHere's what Priyank Upadhyay, VP - Research, SSJ Finance & Securities recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:\n\nAditya Birla Capital: BuyIn June 2022, prices made a low of around 86 and since then it has rallied towards 140, making higher lows and higher high structure as per the Dow theory which is a bullish sign.\n\nPrices are trading above the 20-and 40-day EMA at 128/123 which suggests that the trend and momentum are on the higher side.\nRecently, prices have given a breakout of a flag pattern on the daily charts with targets coming around 155.\n\nVolume has also risen sharply suggesting a strong momentum. RSI is also trading above 60 which is a bullish sign suggesting strong trend ad momentum.\n\nAny dips towards 135/130 zones could act as support for an upmove toward 155-160. A break below Rs 123 could trigger a selloff.\n\n\nBank of India: Book ProfitsPrices have given a breakout from a major one-year consolidation pattern from December 2021 to October 2022, when they broke above 60.\n\nAfter the breakout, prices rose sharply towards 85. This breakout has happened on good volumes and prices are trading above the 20-and 40-Day EMA at 73.90/66.65 suggesting strong momentum and trend.\n\nRSI is trading around 80 which suggests prices are highly overbought and price structure is also suggesting that the up move has come in at a very short time. A dip toward 70/65 cannot be ruled out.\n\nThus, we suggest traders book profits at current levels of 83 and wait for a dip to re-enter around 65/60 zones again for a medium-term investment point of view for targets of around 100 in the next 6 to 8 months.\n\n\nIDBI Bank: Buy on dipsPrices have moved up sharply since July 2022 and have formed a higher low and higher high structure as per the Dow theory.\n\nPrices are trading around the 52-week high of 54 which is a positive sign. The last 4 days have seen a sharp rise in volumes which suggests a rise in price is on good volumes which is a positive sign.\n\nPrices are trading above 20-and 40-Day EMA placing at 48.60 and 46.60 which suggests that the trend and momentum are on the upside.\n\nRSI has just crossed above the 60 mark, on the daily charts suggesting that momentum is building and we could expect prices to rise in short term.\n\nThus, we suggest traders to accumulate this stock on dips to 49/45 zones for targets of 60/65 in short to medium-term risk at 42.\n\n\n(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

The Shanghai Composite index climbed 0.5% to 3,166.23. In Seoul, the Kospi picked up 0.3% to 2,479.84.

The benchmark S&P 500 rose 3.1%, snapping a three-day losing streak and closing at 4,080.11. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.2% to 34,589.77 and the Nasdaq composite climbed 4.4% to 11,468.Small company stocks also rallied.

Apple rose 4.9% and Microsoft jumped 6.2%.“The optimism in the market is that perhaps the worse is over for the U.S. in terms of inflation reading, and the Fed isn’t going to increase the interest aggressively,\" Naeem Aslam of Avatrade said in a commentary.Powell’s comments sent Treasury yields sharply lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury dropped to 3.62% from 3.75% late Tuesday. The yield on the two-year note, which tends to track market expectations of future Fed action, fell to 4.34%. It was trading at 4.48% late Tuesday and had been as high as 4.53% shortly before Powell’s speech.While citing some recent signs that inflation is cooling, Powell stressed that the Fed will push rates higher than previously expected and keep them there for an extended period to ensure inflation comes down sufficiently.AdvertisementArticle continues below this ad“History cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy,” Powell said. “We will stay the course until the job is done.”Major indexes have been unsteady all year as the economy and financial markets dealt with stubbornly hot inflation and the Fed's attempt to cool high prices with aggressive interest rate increases.Wall Street has been hoping that the Fed will slow the scale and pace of its interest rate hikes. It has raised its benchmark interest rate six times since March, driving it to a range of 3.75% to 4%, the highest in 15 years. The goal is to make borrowing more costly and generally slow the economy in order to tame inflation.Higher mortgage rates have caused home sales to plunge and higher interest rates also have raised costs for most other consumer and business loans.AdvertisementArticle continues below this adThe economy has been slowing, and many economists expect the U.S. to slip into a recession next year. But there are strong pockets of growth. The government said Wednesday that the economy expanded at a 2.9% annual rate from July through September, an upgrade from its initial estimate.Consumers have continued spending, despite inflation squeezing wallets. Overall, employment remains strong, though job openings dropped in October more than economists had anticipated and human resources company ADP reported an easing in private sector hiring in November.Investors will get more data Thursday on the employment sector with a report on weekly unemployment claims. The closely watched monthly report on the job market will be released on Friday.In other trading Thursday, U.S. benchmark crude oil lost 41 cents to $80.14 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It climbed 3% on Wednesday.AdvertisementArticle continues below this adBrent crude, the pricing basis for international trading, shed 54 cents to $86.43 a barrel.The U.S. dollar fell to 136.32 Japanese yen from 138.09 yen. The euro rose to $1.0454 from $1.0409.",

They have also lagged during the 4th quarter rally. This weakness has been a drag on major stock indexes such as the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite. With the recent rally phase well underway could the Mega-Cap Growth stocks be preparing to play catchup with a bout of outperformance? The Mega-Cap Stocks have immense capitalization weighting in the major stock indexes. If they shake off their underperforming ways, even temporarily, it could put stock indexes into hyperdrive. We turn to a Swing Trading PnF case study of the QQQ ETF to determine if a ‘Cause' has formed for a rally and the upward potential of that advance. Chart Notes:A potential Swing Trading Accumulation Structure back to September for QQQ.QQQ Mega-Cap stocks have been a performance drag on major stock indexes during 2022.Relative Strength downtrend for the current quarter and the year illustrates the weakness.Relative Strength downtrend since August is attempting to reverse upward.QQQ is now in a Backup position with low volatility and diminished volume.The Overhead Supply trendline is immediately above and is important resistance. Point & Figure Chart Notes:Swing PnF count (yellow shading) has price objectives near the August highs.A rise to this level would exceed the overhead Supply Line and the 200 d.m.a. Better participation from these all-important mega-cap stocks would be a boost to the stock indexes, at least temporarily. A Swing PnF accumulation count appears nearly complete.  This is a very important juncture on the charts, and we should monitor developments closely.All the Best,Bruce@rdwyckoffAnnouncement:Best of Wyckoff Workshop.

		"content": "In an interview with ETMarkets, Amit Jain, Co-founder, Ashika Global Family Office Services, said: “Investors may exit from high P/E stocks as they might face some time correction going forward.” \nEdited excerpts:\n\nIndian market hit a record high in November and the momentum continued in December as well. Where is the market headed?We have been bullish on Indian equities since June 2022, and we continue to have the same stance even going forward.\n\nIndian market is the first market in the G-20 countries that touched a new high in the CY 2022 itself.\n\n\nThe recent rally seen in the Indian market stands out when we compare it to EMs. The rally also makes Indian markets slightly expensive compared to global peers. Will India be able to hold on to the outperformance?\nYes, the Indian market is one of the most expensive emerging markets, but it comes with a reason & i.e. our economic growth potential & less geo-political risk due to non-aligned foreign policy. Hence, in my view, the Indian market deserves this premium valuation.\n\n\nWhere do you see the next set of leaders emerging from?\nThe next leaders will come from IT, pharma & some of the highly undervalued PSU stocks & banks.\n\nLong-term investors should start accumulating these value sectors at the current price for long-term gains. Also, there are some bottom-up buying opportunities in the speciality chemical space as well.\n\n\nRecently, PSU as well as rail stocks have picked up momentum. What is driving the rally in these 2 sectors?\nBoth these sectors had been undervalued for long and hence, we are seeing fresh long positions as NIFTY is very near to touching a new high & these mentioned sectoral stocks are still down 10%-20% from their peaks. Hence, all value investors are buying in these sectors at current levels.\n\n\nAny sector(s) which you think investors can pare their holding as well move towards record highs because it might have already run up?In my view, retail investors may shift from large banks to undervalued IT stocks from a three to five-year perspective. This strategy will most likely create an alpha on their current investment portfolio.\n\nAlso, investors may exit from high P/E stocks as they might face some time correction going forward.\n\n\nShould one consider rejigging their portfolio as markets create history?\nYes, during this possible rejig of a portfolio, investors should keep higher weightage for IT & pharma stocks along with some undervalued midcap banks.\n\nKeep this portfolio weight for at least three to five years to outperform all broader indices.\n\n\nHow do you see export-linked sectors faring in the near future?\nTill now, most of the export-oriented sectors have underperformed in the broader markets. But now this trend may reverse, as most of the negatives are already priced in these sectors at current levels.\n\n\nYour biggest upgrades or downgrades post Q2 results? or your take on September quarter earnings and how will December quarter pan out?\nPost Q2, I am bullish on IT sectors as most of the negatives are already priced in. Also, even if we have a recession in the Western World, we will see more outsourcing to Indian companies. Hence at current levels, most IT companies offer a good value buy proposition.\n\n\nNow that bulls have again taken control of D-St, do you see more IPOs making their comeback to the Street? We have already seen a few in Oct-Nov. Any particular IPO(s) which you are looking forward to?Most IPOs had done well except  Green Energy. In my view, even going forward this outperformance of IPOs will continue as we have enough liquidity in the markets.\n\n\n(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

The BSE Realty index clocked over 4% gains, being the top sectoral index gainer for the week. \n\nAccording to Ruchit Jain, lead research analyst at 5Paisa,com, the realty index has given a major breakout on charts, and therefore, one should consider adding stocks in this pack in their portfolio. \n\nStocks across the board ended positive this week with 1-10% gains, but have corrected from their 52-week highs in the recent months amid the sell-off in the broader market. \n\nAs the risk-reward remains favourable and the outlook for the sector is bright, it has become a major investment bet for most money managers. \n\nThe real estate sector has seen a significant turnaround post Covid, with housing demand gaining traction beyond tier-I and tier-II cities. The demand for residential properties has remained strong even in 2022 when interest rates rose sharply as inflation skyrocketed. \n\nTheoretically, in a high interest rate environment, the sector that gets hit the most is real estate. But this notion was broken as housing demand has been robust in both urban and rural markets as indicated by the data for the September quarter. \n\nData released by property consultant Anarock Group showed that housing sales rose 41% on year and 4% sequentially in Q2, with as many as 88,230 units sold across the top 7 cities. \n\nWith the housing cycle turning and launches improving, Nuvama Wealth Management believes that sales, particularly in the upscale city of Mumbai, would remain healthy going ahead. \n\nAnd this would benefit players like , Oberoi Realty, Godrej Properties and . \n\n\nOther Big Movers\nIn the week, while Nifty 50 and Sensex added about 1% gains, the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices outperformed and gained more than 2% each. \n\nAbout 66 smallcap stocks and 7 midcap stocks gave double-digit returns, according to data provided by Ace Equity. \n\nL&T Technology Services, Bharat Heavy Electricals,  Co, and  were among the big midcap gainers. \n\nShares of  hit a 4-year high of Rs 91.25 on Friday on reports the company was in the race for a Rs 58,000 crore contract to manufacture and maintain Vande Bharat trains for 35 years.\n\nInformation technology stocks, including L&T Technology rose following the rise in their global peers after US Federal Reserve head Jerome Powell said that interest rate hikes are likely to slow down from this month. \n\n\n(With data inputs from Ritesh Presswala)\n\n(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

		"content": "   feedough/iStock via Getty Images Foreword While more than half this collection of Dow Industrials is too pricey and reveals only skinny dividends, four of the five lowest priced Dogs of the Dow are ready to buy. This month, Verizon Communications Inc (VZ), Dow Inc. (DOW), Intel Corp. (INTC), and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), live up to the dogcatcher ideal of annual dividends from $1K invested exceeding their single share prices. Furthermore, two more, Cisco (CSCO) and Coca-Cola Co (KO) showed its prices within $22 of meeting that goal. When the slide continues watch IBM, MMM, JPM (currently out of the top-five) bubble to the surface. With renewed downside market pressure of 59%, it would be possible for all ten to become elite fair-priced dogs with their annual yield (from $1K invested) meeting or exceeding their single share prices by year's end. [See a summary of top ten fair-priced December Dow Dogs in Actionable Conclusion 21 near the middle of this article.]  Actionable Conclusions (1-10): Brokers Expect 8.33% To 26.62% Net Gains From Top-Ten Dow Dogs By December 2023  Four of ten top dividend-yielding Dow dogs (tinted gray in the chart below) were among the top ten gainers for the coming year based on analyst 1-year target prices. So, this December 2023 yield-based forecast for Dow dogs, as graded by Wall St. wizard estimates, was 40% accurate. Estimated dividend-returns from $1000 invested in the ten highest-yielding stocks and their aggregate one-year analyst median target prices, as reported by YCharts, created the 2022-23 data points for the projections below. (Note: one-year target prices estimated by lone analysts were not applied.) Ten probable profit-generating trades projected to December 2023 were: Source: YCharts.com The Walt Disney Co (DIS) was projected to net $266.18, based on the median of target estimates from 29 analysts, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to risk/volatility 80% under the market as a whole. Salesforce Inc (CRM) was projected to net $262.39, based on the median of target price estimates from 45 analysts, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to risk/volatility 10% greater than the market as a whole. Verizon Communications Inc was projected to net $249.41, based on dividends, plus the median of target price estimates from 23 analysts, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to risk/volatility 62% less than the market as a whole. Apple Inc (AAPL) was forecast to net $173.66, based on the median of target price estimates from 41 analysts, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to risk/volatility 22% greater than the market as a whole. Microsoft Corp (MSFT) was projected to net $164.77, based on the median of target price estimates from 44 analysts, plus the estimated annual dividend, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to risk/volatility 7% less than the market as a whole. Visa Inc (V) was projected to net $129.64, based on dividends, plus the median of target price estimates from 32 analysts, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to risk/volatility 5% under the market as a whole. Intel Corp was projected to net $129.39 based on the median of target price estimates from 35 analysts, plus dividends, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to risk/volatility 25% less than the market as a whole. Cisco Systems Inc was projected to net $116.74, based on dividends, plus the median target price estimates from 22 analysts, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to risk/volatility equal to the market as a whole. 3M Co (MMM) netted $107.40 based on the median of target price estimates from 18 analysts, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to risk/volatility 1% greater than the market as a whole. The Home Depot Inc (HD) was projected to net $83.29, based on the median of target prices estimated by 30 analysts, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to risk/volatility4% less than the market as a whole. The average net gain in dividend and price was estimated at 16.83% on $10k invested as $1k in each of these top ten Dow Index stocks. This gain estimate was subject to average risk/volatility 15% less than the market as a whole. Source: Open source dog art from dividenddogcatcher.com The Dividend Dogs Rule Stocks earned the \"dog\" moniker by exhibiting three traits: (1) paying reliable, repeating dividends, (2) their prices fell to where (3) yield (dividend/price) grew higher than their peers. Thus, the highest yielding stocks in any collection became known as \"dogs.\" More precisely, these are, in fact, best called, \"underdogs\".  The December 2022 Dow 30 By Yield  Source: YCharts.com   Actionable Conclusions (11-20): 10 Top Dow Dividend Stocks By Yield Ranged 2.77% To 6.93% Per YCharts   Top ten Dow dogs as of 11/30/22 represented eight of eleven Morningstar sectors. The lone communication services sector member took first place, Verizon [1]. In second place was the lone basic materials dog, Dow Inc [2]. Then three technology dogs placed in the third, sixth, and eighth positions, Intel Corp [3], International Business Machines (IBM) [6], and Cisco Systems Inc [8]. A lone industrials dog was fourth, 3M Co [4], healthcare paced fifth, represented by Walgreens Boots Alliance [5], and another lone energy representative was seventh, Chevron (CVX) [7]. Finally, ninth place belonged to the financial services representative, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM) [9], and tenth went to the consumer defensive standout, Coca-Cola Co [10], to complete the incoming December Dogs of the Dow by yield lists from YCharts. Source: YCharts.com  Dividend Vs. Price Results A graph above shows the relative strengths of the top ten Dow dogs by dividend and price as of market close 11/30/2022. This month six of the top-ten Dow dogs show an overbought condition (in which aggregate single share price of those six exceeds projected annual dividend from $10k invested as $1k each). A dividend dogcatcher priority is to select stocks whose dividends from $1K invested exceed their single share price. As mentioned above, that condition was reached by four of the five lowest priced Dogs of the Dow: Verizon Communications, Dow Inc, Intel Corp, and Walgreens Boots Alliance, live up to the dogcatcher ideal of annual dividends from $1K invested exceeding their single share prices. Furthermore, two more, Cisco Systems, showed a price within $10.72 and Coca-Cola Co came within $21.64 of meeting that ideal goal as of November 30. Actionable Conclusion (21): Six of Ten Top Dow Dogs Are Overbought This gap between high share price and low dividend per $1k (or oversold condition) means, no matter which chart you read, 23 of all 27 Dow dividend payers are low risk and low opportunity dogs, with the non-dividend payers being particularly dismal. The Dow top-ten average cost per dollar of annual dividend for November 31, 2022, was $25.39 per YCharts. One that cut its dividend after March, 2020, Boeing (BA), has re-learned (and is now certified that it knows how to fly in some countries) and is thus prepared to take off again when airlines trust planes made in the USA again. The used plane and airbus market, however, is soaring. BA is struggling to recover from being in worse shape than was GE when excised from the Dow index. As for DIS, the magic kingdom may never be close to reinstating a dividend. Furthermore, the newest of the three latest no-dividend stocks on the block, CRM, is simply overpriced, yet fading rapidly, as their CEO unexpectedly bailed out, Those three non-dividend payers are the true down in the dumps dogs of the Dow, despite analysts high-balling their future share price estimates. All of the three demonstrate a total disregard for shareholders. Remember this dogcatcher yield-based stock-picking strategy is contrarian. That means rooting for (buying) the underdog is productive when you don't already own these stocks. If you do hold these stocks, then you must look for opportune pull-backs in price to add to your position to best improve your dividend yield. Plenty of pull-back opportunities appear to be ahead. Price Drops or Dividend Increases Could Get All Ten Dow Dogs Back to \"Fair Price\" Rates For Investors Source: YCharts.com The charts above retain the current dividend amount and adjust the share price to produce a yield (from $1K invested) to equal or exceed the single share price of each stock. As the top illustration shows, four are ideally priced. Beside Verizon Communications, Dow Inc, Intel Corp, and Walgreens Boots Alliance, breaking into the ideal zone, two more low-priced stocks are within $2@ of making the grade, Cisco Corp is $11 away, and Coca-Cola Co is $22 within goal. Four more, however (IBM; MMM; CVX; JPM) need to trim prices between $49 and $108. to attain that elusive 50/50 goal. The alternative, of course, could be that these companies raise their dividends but that is a lot to ask in these highly disrupted, inflationary, yet cash-rich times. Mr. Market is much more effective at moving prices up or down to appropriate amounts, just watch and buy when the targeted stock price moves into the sweet spot. Source: YCharts.com  Actionable Conclusions: (22-31) The Dow Index Showed 7.01% To 27.62% Top Ten Upsides To December 2023; (32) Eight Downsides of -0.47% to -9.99% Were Revealed By Broker 1-Yr. Targets   To quantify top dog rankings, analyst median price target estimates provided a \"market sentiment\" gauge of upside potential. Added to the simple high-yield \"dog\" metrics, analyst median price target estimates provided another tool to dig out bargains.  Analysts Forecast A 39.91% Advantage For 5 Highest-Yield, Lowest-Priced of 10 Dow Dogs As Of November 30, 2023  Ten top Dow dogs were culled by yield for their monthly update. Yield (dividend / price) results as verified by YCharts did the ranking. Source: YCharts.com As noted above, top-ten Dow dogs selected 11/30/22 by YCharts methods revealing the highest dividend-yields represented eight of the eleven sectors. Consumer Cyclical selections were missing. (Real Estate is not reported and Utilities has its own Dow Index.)  Actionable Conclusions: Analysts Expected 5 Lowest-Priced of the Ten Highest-Yield Dow Dogs (34) To Deliver 11.35% Vs. (35) 8.11% Net Gains by All Ten Come November 30, 2023  Source: YCharts.com $5000 invested as $1k in each of the five lowest-priced stocks in the top ten Dow Dividend kennel by yield were predicted by analyst 1-year targets to deliver 39.91% more gain than from $5,000 invested in all ten. The second lowest priced top ten stock, Verizon Communications Inc, showed top analyst-estimated gains of 24.94%.   Source: YCharts.com The five lowest-priced Dow top-yield dogs for November 30 were: Intel Corp; Verizon Communications Inc; Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc; Cisco Systems Inc; Dow Inc, with prices ranging from $30.07 to $50.97. Five higher-priced Dow top-yield dogs for October 31 were: Coca-Cola Co; 3M Co; JPMorgan Chase & Co; International Business Machines Corp; Chevron Corp, whose prices ranged from $63.61 to $183.31. The distinction between five low-priced dividend dogs and the general field of ten reflected Michael B. O'Higgins' \"basic method\" for beating the Dow. The scale of projected gains based on analyst targets added a unique element of \"market sentiment\" gauging upside potential. It provided a here-and-now equivalent of waiting a year to find out what might happen in the market. Caution is advised since analysts are historically only 20% to 85% accurate on the direction of change and just 0% to 15% accurate on the degree of change. (In 2017 the market somewhat followed analyst sentiment. In 2018 analysts estimates were contrarian indicators of market performance, and they continued to be contrary for the first two quarters of 2019 but switched to conforming for the last two quarters.) In 2020 analyst projections were quite contrarian. The first half of 2021 most dividend stock price actions exceeded all analyst expectations. The last half of 2021 was still gangbusters. The 2022 September sag may free-up five or more Dow dogs, sending them into the ideal zone where returns from $1k invested equal (or exceed) their single-share price. Afterword Lest there be any doubt about the recommendations in this article, this month there were four Dow Index stocks showing dividends for $1k invested exceeding single share price: Intel Corp, Verizon Communications, Walgreens Boots Alliance, and Dow Inc. The dogcatcher hands off recommendations are still in place referring to one that cut its dividend in March 2020. While Boeing, has re-learned (and is certified in certain countries) to fly, it still has to coax customers to buy planes again. BA faces strong headwinds to stay on the Dow index (despite analyst optimism for the lone U.S. commercial air-crafter). Also keep hands off the newest non-dividend member of the Dow, Salesforce.com Inc, until it declares a dividend from $1K invested greater than its single share price, perhaps new leadership will help. While subscriptions keep the ship afloat, Disney needs audiences to get strapped back into buying tickets to watch and ride and may never resume a dividend. Meanwhile DIS has Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Paramount, and numerous other content providers pouring out streamable content. Will the mouse house ever roar again, let-alone, pay dividends? The net gain/loss estimates above did not factor in any foreign or domestic tax problems resulting from distributions.

		"content": "   Luis Alvarez The final month of the year is usually an insane month for the holidays. Family, food, football… it's the best! Let’s make sure that December is also going to be an excellent month for dividend investing as well. Lanny recently published his December Dividend Stock Watch List, featuring 3 great dividend stocks. You know what? Now it is my turn. Here are Bert's 3 Dividend Stocks to Buy on his December dividend stock watch list! The month of December was a frustrating month for dividend investors. Many of the discounts we saw over the last couple of quarters disappear. In November, the S&P 500 increased over 9%. The market is once again well over 4,000. The way December is starting, it is looking like it is picking up where November left off.    This week, Jerome Powell suggested that the interest rate hikes may slow down earlier than anticipated, causing the market to soar. That, coupled with other headlines indicating that inflation may be easing, left investors feeling great and the market soaring. Still, despite the increase in the market, there are still plenty of buying opportunities out there. There may not be a ton of screaming buys out there and it may take longer to find them. However, there are many great stocks if you look hard enough and stick to your personal investment philosophy and dividend stock screener. That’s why Lanny and I are always building watch lists. To find ways to put our hard-earned cash to work. Time to keep focusing on building our passive income stream by buying more dividend growth stocks. Dividend Diplomat Stock Screener To find and analyze undervalued dividend stocks, we use 3 simple metrics to evaluate every dividend stock. The goal of our stock screener is to identify if a stock is an undervalued dividend growth stock to buy. Here is a rundown of the 3 metrics of our stock screener: 1.) Price to Earnings Ratio Less than the S&P 500. Currently, the S&P 500 is trading at a P/E Ratio of 19.83X. 2.) Dividend Payout Ratio Less than 60% (Although we think a perfect payout ratio is 40% – 60%). The payout ratio measures the safety of the dividend. This ensures the company can continue growing its dividend during good times and bad. That’s why it is a critical metric in our stock screener that we must evaluate! 3.) History of Increasing Dividends. We review this metric by reviewing the company’s five-year average dividend growth rate and consecutive annual dividend increases. Since we are long-term investors, it is important that a company increases its dividend consistently! Bonus: Dividend Yield. We like to also throw in a bonus metric to our dividend stock analysis. Yield does not drive our decision; however, we would be lying if we said we completely ignore dividend yield. Dividend Stock #1: Citigroup (C) Citigroup has been a staple in my wife’s portfolio over the last year. We started purchasing last year when the price was in the high $50 – low $60 per share range. Once inflation spiked and talks of a recession picked up steam, the company’s stock price fell. Now, like Warren Buffett, my wife and I keep adding slowly to our Citi position. At the time of this article, my wife owns 54.967 shares. She receives over $100 in annual dividend income from Citi. We would love to continue building this position and eventually receive 1 share per quarter via DRIP. Let’s see the metrics. Citi’s stock price is $47.24 per share at the time of this article. The company’s forward EPS is $6.39 per share and the annual dividend is $2.04 per share. Let’s see how the metrics shake out. 1.) Price to Earnings Ratio: 7.39x. 2.) Dividend Payout Ratio: 31.9%. 3.) History of Increasing Dividends: Citi’s 5-year DGR is 16.27%, although this is slightly misleading. The company has not increased its dividend since the pandemic started in 2020. The dividend growth was front loaded. 4.) Dividend Yield: 4.32%. Bonus.) Price to Book Ratio: .51X (This is extremely low. We consider a bank undervalued if its Price to Book ratio is 1X or 1.1X or lower). Dividend Stock #2: Qualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm is another tech stock that has been one of my favorite purchases in 2022. Qualcomm dropped into the low $100s a month or two ago. After a recent appreciation in the stock price, the stock price has settled in the $120s per share. Now, we have built our position to 14.122 shares in total. Driving this position up to 20 shares in a short period of time would be great. Qualcomm’s stock price is $125.66 per share at the time of this article. Qualcomm’s earnings per share is $10.23 per share and the company’s annual dividend is an even $3.00 per share. The company’s metrics are as follows: 1.) Price to Earnings Ratio: 12.28x. 2.) Dividend Payout Ratio: 29.3%. 3.) History of Increasing Dividends: Qualcomm has a 5-year average dividend growth rate of 5.52% and has increased its dividend for 11+ consecutive years. 4.) Dividend Yield: 2.39%. Dividend Stock #3: Realty income (O) One position that I’ve wanted to add to over the last few years, but never have actually purchased is Realty Income. A long time ago, I amassed a position of 121 shares in my Roth IRA. The monthly dividends have been great, adding over $20 each month. This company is the GOAT in the REIT sector and the gold standard for dividend growth investors. Therefore, I continue asking myself… why have I not just increased my position to at least 150 shares! Realty Income’s stock price is $62.90 per share at the time of this article. Since Realty Income is a REIT, we will use Realty’s Funds From Operations (FFO) instead of earnings per share to evaluate the stock. FFO is the standard metric in the REIT industry! Realty Income’s FFO is $3.99 per share and the company’s annual dividend is $2.98 per share. The company’s metrics are as follows: 1.) Price to FFO Ratio: 15.76x. 2.) Dividend Payout Ratio: 75.6%. 3.) History of Increasing Dividends: Realty Income is a newly crowned Dividend Aristocrat and has increased its dividend for 25+ consecutive years. Realty’s 5-year average dividend growth rate is 3.93% as well. 4.) Dividend Yield: 4.74%. Summary – December Dividend Stock Watch List Now that we know the 3 dividend stocks on my December dividend stock watch list, what am I going to do? Which dividend stock on my watch list is my favorite? Simple. I actually like all 3 stocks and I’m strongly going to consider adding to each of the positions next week. The metrics are solid. They are great dividend growth stocks. So why not just buy all 3 companies? It seems like a pretty simple answer to me. Sometimes with investing, we need to remember to keep it simple and buy stocks when they are showing signs of undervaluation. What do you think of the 3 stocks on my December dividend stock watch list? Do you like Citi, Qualcomm and Realty Income? If not, what other stocks do you prefer instead?

		"content": "Topline\nChinese and Hong Kong stocks rallied on Monday and the renminbi jumped against the dollar, a positive sign of returning investor confidence amid rising public discontent and ongoing economic turmoil from years of strict lockdown, though experts are not universally optimistic China can cope well with the inevitable wave of infections reopening entails.\nChina is reportedly relaxing its zero-Covid pandemic curbs. Getty Images \n\nKey Facts\n\n \n  On Monday, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index rose 4.5% and China’s CSI 300 index—a measure of the largest mainland-listed companies—rose nearly 2%, both indices' highest level since September.\n  \n \n \n  The renminbi also gained ground and was up more than 1% against the U.S. dollar on Monday, moving past 7 to the U.S. dollar and to its highest level since September.\n  \n \n \n  Oil prices also jumped amid hopes of increased Chinese demand, with global benchmark Brent and U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate both up more than 2%.\n  \n  \n \n \n  Morgan Stanley upgraded Chinese equities to overweight on Sunday after almost two years at an equal-weight position, optimism the firm said was buoyed by numerous positive developments in China and what it viewed as a path to future reopening.\n \n Goldman Sachs, already bullish on Chinese equity markets, said on Monday there was now a greater possibility China would abandon its zero-Covid policy before April, when it previously predicted China would reopen.\n\n\n\nContra\nInvestment firms are not universally effusive about China’s potential reopening. Many economists and health experts expect restrictions to stay in place until the middle of 2023 at least and possibly stretching into 2024. Ting Lu, an economist for Japanese investment bank Nomura, warned Monday that the “road to reopening may be gradual, painful and bumpy,” noting that China is ill-prepared for a large wave of infections. Chetan Seth, an equity strategist at the bank, told the Wall Street Journal the current market optimism “is exactly what we saw in some other markets globally in their initial phases of reopening.”\n\nKey Background\nMarket optimism and optimistic comments from investment firms come as part of an increasingly bullish attitude towards China from global investors, particularly in recent weeks as hopes grow Beijing will relax its strict zero-Covid policies. China’s policies—geared towards eliminating, rather than controlling, Covid—have been applied harshly and with broad strokes, often locking down entire cities over a few cases. As the world's second largest economy and the world’s leading exporter, the economic impact of zero-Covid reaches far beyond China’s borders and its continuation threatens global recovery. It has led to the shutdown of factories, cities and other economic hubs and influenced the import and export of goods, which has caused global supply chain issues and shortages.\nNews Peg\nWaves of protests rippled across China last week targeting Beijing’s strict Covid-19 restrictions. The demonstrations are one of largest displays of civil unrest seen in mainland China for decades and, unusually, directly called out Chinese President Xi Jinping and the communist government. The protests came amid record cases—which pale in comparison to U.S. figures—and demonstrators demanded Beijing drop the curbs, which have been criticized widely outside of China as unsustainable and ineffective. Beijing, while still upholding the policy, has started to show signs it is softening its approach and some cities have started easing restrictions.\nWhat To Watch For\nChina could be poised to announce a flurry of new easing measures as early as Wednesday, according to Reuters. Citing two sources familiar with the matter, Reuters said 10 new measures to ease restrictions could be introduced to supplement the 20 already unveiled in November. Easing measures already in place include home quarantine for those testing positive and removing the need to show negative tests to use public transport.\n\nFurther Reading\nProtesters win a partial victory as Chinese cities start to loosen Covid controls (CNN)\nChina’s Zero-Covid Strategy: What Is It, Why Are People Protesting And What Comes Next (Forbes)\nChina’s Worst Reported Month Of Covid Was Nothing Compared To The United States (Forbes)\nFull coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Send me a secure tip. ",

		"content": "If only your bitcoin could catch on fire — literally — then it might have a chance of being covered by insurance. For property, fire is a straightforward hazard. But it’s probably the one big thing that can’t befall a digital currency among a host of inflictions — see FTX, BlockFi and other failures. \n       As it stands, there’s not much protection for cryptocurrency — no FDIC or SIPC insurance from the U.S. government to protect against institutional failures, no broad coverage under homeowners insurance as property and very little by way of individual cyber theft coverage. Some exchanges have large policies for themselves.  With established brokerages including Fidelity Investments entering the crypto-selling arena, and discussions about potential regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, this situation could change. But for now, you’re the guardian of your crypto, and your best defense is being aware of the potential harms and how you can best protect yourself.  “You’re never going to be able to eliminate all the risks. But you can see if there’s some low-hanging fruit to make it a little bit more safe,” says Michael Menapace, a non-resident scholar at the Insurance Information Institute, and also an attorney and law professor.  Here’s the top things you need to think about in order to protect your crypto: Loss of value Bitcoin \n        BTCUSD,\n        -0.34%\n       and ether \n        ETHUSD,\n        -1.10%\n       are down more than 60% this year, and there’s nothing any insurance can do about that. “Cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile, and investors should only allocate money they are willing to lose,” Fidelity says in a statement to its potential crypto investors.  But you can be strategic about other kinds of crypto-related investments you pick to avoid a complete loss, like sticking to established coins, investing in ETF products related to crypto or employing hedging strategies. Institutional failure FDIC insurance protects individuals from the failure of banks. SIPC insurance, in turn, protects against the failure of securities companies regulated by the SEC.  The way it works at companies such as Robinhood\n        HOOD,\n        -2.35%,\n       Coinbase\n        COIN,\n        -2.02%,\n       Gemini, Fidelity and others is that they partner with regulated financial institutions to provide sweep accounts for cash on hand, which get pass-through FDIC or SIPC coverage, depending on which applies. But that’s only while it’s in cash. Once your assets are in crypto form, they’re not covered for institutional failure. As Fidelity specifies: “FDIC insurance protects against loss in the event of a failure of the cash depository; it does not protect you against loss in the event of a failure of Fidelity Digital Assets.” Still, Menapace sees the coming of major players into the space as a way for individuals to potentially protect themselves. These companies are, regardless of their crypto divisions, “highly regulated, generally liquid companies, that would have assets to pay if something terrible happened,” he says. Institutional theft If your crypto is in the custody of a major financial company and it gets robbed, you may have some relief. Most of the bigger players have cyber theft policies, many underwritten by Lloyd’s of London.  Robinhood, for example, says: “We carry crime insurance that covers a portion of the cryptocurrency held across our storage systems against losses from theft, including cybersecurity breaches.”  But if it’s just you who gets robbed, you’re pretty much on your own.  Coinbase says it “carries crime insurance that protects a portion of digital currencies held across our storage systems against losses from theft, including cybersecurity breaches. However, our policy does not cover any losses resulting from unauthorized access to your personal Coinbase or Coinbase Pro account(s) due to a breach or loss of your credentials.”Direct theft The IRS defines cryptocurrency as property for the purposes of taxation, but that does not extend to homeowner’s insurance, which would cover a stolen television. It also likely wouldn’t extend to the way a homeowner’s policy deals with stolen cash, but it depends on the policy. In any case, stolen cash claims are typically limited to no more than several hundred dollars, which would be a mere fraction of a bitcoin.  Menapace sees the most likely resolution of this situation coming from the SEC, which could eventually designate cryptocurrency to be a security and regulate it the same way as stocks. “That’s not a panacea either,” Menapace says. “The next question is if the SEC regulates cryptocurrency as a security, does that mean they’ll be insurable or not insurable as securities?”  There are some specialty policies for cyber theft, with many caveats. Breach, for one, started offering a Crypto Shield product in February that covers assets held in a qualified exchange if they are stolen outright or subject to a data breach at the custodian. The cost to insure is roughly 1.5% to 2% of holdings, says Eyhab Aejaz, CEO of Breach. A quote on the site for New York coverage of 1 bitcoin is $27 a month for 100% coverage at the day’s value, with a 15% deductible.  If you hold crypto in cold storage — which means it’s in your own custody on a hard drive or similar device, though — you’re on your own. This is where you need common sense the most. Use digital-safety best practices such as enabling two-factor authentication wherever possible. Coinbase recommends a code generator or two-factor key, a strong password, not sharing passwords, making sure you have a legacy plan for your digital wallet information and, maybe most importantly, physically locking your doors.

OPEC+ had earlier agreed to cut output by two million bpd, about two per cent of world demand, from November until the end of 2023.Still, oil prices are down more than 30% from their 52-week highs while, curiously, the energy sector is within just four percent of its high. Indeed, over the past two months, the energy sector’s leading benchmark, the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA: XLE), has climbed 34% while average crude spot prices have declined 18%. This is a notable divergence because the correlation between the two over the past five years is 77% and 69% over the past decade. According to Bespoke Investment Group via the Wall Street Journal, the current split marks the first time since 2006 that the oil and gas sector has traded within 3% of a 52-week high while the WTI price retreated more than 25% from its respective 52-week high. It’s also only the fifth such divergence since 1990.David Rosenberg, founder of independent research firm Rosenberg Research & Associates Inc, has outlined 5 key reasons why energy stocks remain a buy despite oil prices failing to make any major gains over the past couple of months.#1. Favorable ValuationsEnergy stocks remain cheap despite the huge runup. Not only has the sector widely outperformed the market, but companies within this sector remain relatively cheap, undervalued, and come with above-average projected earnings growth.\n\n\nRosenberg has analyzed PE ratios by energy stocks by looking at historical data since 1990 and found that, on average, the sector ranks in just its 27th percentile historically. In contrast, the S&P 500 sits in its 71st percentile despite the deep selloff that happened earlier in the year.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSome of the cheapest oil and gas stocks right now include Ovintiv Inc. (NYSE: OVV) with a PE ratio of 6.09; Civitas Resources, Inc. (NYSE: CIVI) with a PE ratio of 4.87, Enerplus Corporation (NYSE: ERF)(TSX: ERF) has  PE ratio of 5.80,  Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: OXY) has a PE ratio of 7.09 while Canadian Natural Resources Limited (NYSE: CNQ) has a PE ratio of 6.79.#2. Robust EarningsStrong earnings by energy companies are a big reason why investors are still flocking to oil stocks.Third quarter earnings season is nearly over, but so far it’s shaping up to be better-than-feared. According to FactSet’s earnings insights, for Q3 2022, 94% of S&P 500 companies have reported Q3 2022 earnings, of which 69% have reported a positive EPS surprise and 71% have reported a positive revenue surprise.The Energy sector has reported the highest earnings growth of all eleven sectors at 137.3% vs. 2.2% average by the S&P 500. At the sub-industry level, all five sub-industries in the sector reported a year-over-year increase in earnings: Oil & Gas Refining & Marketing (302%), Integrated Oil & Gas (138%), Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (107%), Oil & Gas Equipment & Services (91%), and Oil & Gas Storage & Transportation (21%). Energy is also the sector that has most companies beating Wall Street estimates at 81%. The positive revenue surprises reported by Marathon Petroleum ($47.2 billion vs. $35.8 billion), Exxon Mobil ($112.1 billion vs. $104.6 billion), Chevron ($66.6 billion vs. $57.4 billion), Valero Energy ($42.3 billion vs. $40.1billion), and Phillips 66 ($43.4 billion vs. $39.3 billion) were significant contributors to the increase in the revenue growth rate for the index since September 30. Even better, the outlook for the energy sector remains bright. According to a recent Moody's research report, industry earnings will stabilize overall in 2023, though they will come in slightly below levels reached by recent peaks. The analysts note that commodity prices have declined from very high levels earlier in 2022, but have predicted that prices are likely to remain cyclically strong through 2023. This, combined with modest growth in volumes, will support strong cash flow generation for oil and gas producers. Moody’s estimates that the U.S. energy sector’s EBITDA for 2022 will clock in at $$623B but fall to $585B in 2023. \n\n\n\nThe analysts say that low capex, rising uncertainty about the expansion of future supplies and high geopolitical risk premium will, however, continue to support cyclically high oil prices. Meanwhile, strong export demand for U.S. LNG will continue supporting high natural gas prices.In other words, there simply aren’t better places for people investing in the U.S. stock market to park their money if they are looking for serious earnings growth. Further, the outlook for the sector remains bright.Whereas oil and gas prices have declined from recent highs, they are still much higher than they have been over the past couple of years hence the ongoing enthusiasm in the energy markets. Indeed, the energy sector remains a huge Wall Street favorite, with the Zacks Oils and Energy sector being the top-ranked sector out of all 16 Zacks Ranked Sectors.#3. Strong Payouts to ShareholdersOver the past two years, U.S. energy companies have changed their former playbook from using most of their cash flows for production growth to returning more cash to shareholders via dividends and buybacks.Consequently, the combined dividend and buyback yield for the energy sector is now approaching 8%, which is high by historical standards. Rosenberg  notes that similarly elevated levels occurred in 2020 and 2009, which preceded periods of strength. In comparison, the combined dividend and buyback yield for the S&P 500 is closer to five per cent, which makes for one of largest gaps in favor of the energy sector on record.#4. Low InventoriesDespite sluggish demand, U.S. inventory levels are at their lowest level since mid-2000 despite the Biden administration trying to lower prices by flooding markets with 180 million barrels of crude from the SPR. Rosenberg notes that other potential catalysts that could result in additional upward pressure on prices include Russian oil price cap, a further escalation in the Russia/Ukraine war and China pivoting away from its Zero COVID-19 policy.#5. Higher embedded “OPEC+ put”Rosenberg makes a point that OPEC+ is now more comfortable with oil trading above $90 per barrel as opposed to the $60-$70 range they accepted in recent years. The energy expert says this is the case because the cartel is less concerned about losing market share to U.S. shale producers since the latter have prioritized payouts to shareholders instead of aggressive production growth.The new stance by OPEC+ offer better visibility and predictability for oil prices while prices in the $90 per barrel range can sustain strong payouts via dividends and buybacks.By Alex Kimani for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Higher Oil Prices May Convince OPEC To Maintain ProductionPutin Tells Scholz More Ukraine Energy Strikes 'Inevitable'European Leaders Call On NATO To Protect Pipelines And Communication Cables\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

		"content": "Last fall I published an analysis of oil markets (https://lnkd.in/ghBwNMf9), together with some predictions for the year ahead (i.e. 2022). This post looks at how these predictions did. Last year's article also summarized a series of pieces published over the preceding decade in which I lay out a thesis that volatility in oil price since 2000 has developed a striking oscillating pattern. This cycle is marked by phases of elevated instability in oil markets that repeat every 3 to 4 years, with past bouts of volatility having occurred in 2001, 2005, 2008, 2011, 2014, & 2018.  \t   \tLinks to these earlier articles are listed with my podcast  \tinterview with author James Kunstler - https://lnkd.in/gGKqzTHN.  \t   \tThree predictions were inferred in the 2021 article:  \t1: The next bout of oil price volatility would initiate mid-Nov 2021 &  \t2: If this next wave of volatility occurred, disruption would ensue in stock markets in outgoing months  \t3: & would be associated with increased inflation.  \t   \tSo how did these 3 predictions do?  \t1: Oil price volatility first spiked on Nov 29 2021, with the largest peak in the current phase cresting early March 2022.  \t2: From Jan to Sep 2022 the stock market showed remarkable volatility, including swings down from highs of >25 % (S&P).  \t3: Since Dec 2021 inflation has been above 7 %, rising to 9.1 % in June 2022  \t   \tOverall, the sequence has played out pretty much as it has during the past 6 waves of the cycle. If you look at the articles linked to the Kunstler podcast it’ll be seen that similar predictions were made on oil price and downstream impacts on the stock market in 2011, 2014, & 2018.  \t   \tThere is no magic to these forecasts. With with the aid of derivative calculus, fast Fourier transformation and basic statistics, it has not been that difficult to make accurate predictions based on an oscillation that has maintained a relatively fixed structure over 25 years.  \t   \tAs straightforward as the technical side/math has been, the head-scratcher is that few people, particularly those of influence and in leadership positions, seem to recognize or understand the danger that this phenomenon poses to our economy and indeed, civilization at large. Having said this, it is interesting that Mr Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine (on Feb 24), coincided to within days of the crest of the 2022 wave.  Important here is that the heralding spike of the present wave occurred on 29 November 2021 (as enumerated above), well before the invasion. This means that whilst the Ukraine war was probably an amplifying factor, its effects likely occurred downstream of the ultimate cause of the present phase of  oil price volatility. I'd posit that this ultimate cause is whatever is driving the underlying multi-year oscillation, which in past essays, including the 2021 article linked to this post, has been speculated to be Peak Oil-related. It might further be speculated that Putin's timing  was purposefully aligned with a phase during which he calculated the West would be weak, based on past consequences of the cycle of instability on our economy and politics. That Putin is intimately familiar with the details and downstream implications of fluxes in oil markets would be unsurprising given the centrality of fossil fuels to Russia, though we will probably never know whether this was factored into his calculations.  \t   \tIn closing, the next transient phase volatility in oil price in the cycle is likely to start sometime between the latter half of 2025 and the first half of 2026.",

To explain her analysis, he examined the daily chart of the S&P 500.Inskip believes the market's gains from mid-October through the end of last week was a bear market rally – in other words, a temporary bounce in a larger downward trend, he said.He also reminded investors that the market is at the mercy of the Fed's interest rate increases, and the central bank's inflation strategy is beholden to the labor market.When November's hotter-than-expected labor report was released on Dec. 2, the S&P failed to jump two key ceilings of resistance.\"Inskip thinks we went right back into bear market mode,\" Cramer said. \"The S&P can still escape from this new trajectory, but she won't have much confidence in a bounce unless we blow through last Friday's levels.\"For more analysis, watch Cramer's full explanation below.Jim Cramer's Guide to InvestingClick here to download Jim Cramer's Guide to Investing at no cost to help you build long-term wealth and invest smarter.",

		"publishedAt": 1670520564000,
		"content": "\nWhat happened\nOil stocks had a good start to the morning on Thursday, with shares of Chevron (CVX 0.63%) gaining 2.2% through 10 a.m. ET, ExxonMobil (XOM 1.20%) up 2.8%, and oilfield services company Core Laboratories (CLB 2.06%) rising 3% -- and no wonder.\nBy all accounts, China seems to be relaxing its zero-Covid policies, which should benefit its economy and  boost its oil demand. Oil prices logically moved higher in response, with West Texas Intermediate crude up 1.3% and Brent crude inching higher as well. Best of all, management at ExxonMobil just released a bullish forecast for the company's next five years.  \n\nSo what\nIn a conference call with investors Thursday morning, and in an accompanying press release, ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods and CFO Kathryn Mikells explained how the energy giant intends to spend up to $25 billion annually on capital investments through 2027, reduce operating costs, pay down debt, and buy back $50 billion worth of stock over the next two years -- all while maintaining profits and cash flow at twice the levels ExxonMobil had in 2019, before the pandemic began.  \nOil sector investors of all stripes seem to be responding well to what ExxonMobil described as its \"five-year plan.\" Chevron stock gained in apparent sympathy, and Core Labs -- which benefits from increased capital investment by the oil majors -- gained even more. Yet all three companies' early stock price gains seem to be fading a bit as the day wears on.\nWhy might that be?\nNow what\nWhile words like \"billion\" and \"double\" may immediately draw the eyes of investors -- and ExxonMobil's promises to pay down debt and buy back stock are clearly shareholder-friendly moves -- consider what the company is actually saying about its outlook.\nOver the past 12 months, ExxonMobil has reported $51.9 billion in GAAP net earnings, and generated positive operating cash flow of $76.3 billion, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. But note that when management says it will \"double\" earnings and cash flow by 2027, it isn't using its 2022 numbers as a reference point, but rather its 2019 numbers.\nAnd what did ExxonMobil earn in 2019? Again referring to S&P data, Exxon's 2019 profits were only $14.3 billion, and its cash flow was $29.7 billion. Granted, these numbers are also big -- but they're not as huge as the profits it reaped in 2022, a year in which oil markets were thrown into turmoil by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, not to mention the other geopolitical issues that crimped crude supply even as demand rose.\nUsing 2019 as a reference point, ExxonMobil's prediction that 2027 profits and cash flow will \"double\" would appear to work out to a prediction of 2027 earnings of roughly $28 billion or $29 billion, and cash flow in the neighborhood of $60 billion.\nAgain -- big numbers. But these numbers are nonetheless far less than what ExxonMobil has been earning this year. And not to beat a dead horse, but that means that five years from now, management expects ExxonMobil will earn less than it is earning today. I suspect that the reason the stock prices of ExxonMobil, Chevron, and Core Labs have been retracing their paths is that this is becoming clearer to investors.\nRather than boasting of its future profits, what ExxonMobil really did Thursday is remind investors that oil is a cyclical industry, and that today's boom times will not last.\n\nRich Smith has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Core Laboratories. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.\n",

		"content": "   ferrantraite The Chemicals industry is perking up against the S&P 500 lately. While there is no good ETF tracking the space, there are a handful of both domestic and multinational stocks you can buy to get exposure to the space. One name reported a poor quarter, but bullish price action in China has been lifting shares lately. Chemicals Called Higher vs S&P 500   Fidelity Investments According to Bank of America Global Research, Tronox (NYSE:TROX) is a leader in the global titanium dioxide (TiO2) pigment industry and is the largest fully integrated producer. Through its upstream mining business, the company produces mineral sand pigment raw materials as well as byproducts such as zircon and pig iron. Tronox then processes its mineral sands into TiO2 pigment, which is used to impart opacity and light refractivity into coatings, plastics, and paper. The Connecticut-based $2.3 billion market cap Chemicals industry company within the Materials sector trades at a low 3.9 trailing 12-month GAAP price-to-earnings ratio and pays a sizable dividend yield of 3.4%, according to The Wall Street Journal. There are positive price and sales trends for TROX despite a tough macro environment. While many stocks feature negative EPS growth right now, TROX per-share profits are expected to be slightly higher this year. TROX underwent restructuring in previous years, so the hope is that there are synergies generated from those changes. There is downside risk to the stock, however, should Tio2 and zircon prices fall if a global recession strikes. Moreover, weakening consumption of paint and coatings would be bearish. On valuation, analysts at BofA see earnings indeed rising modestly this year but then retreating in 2023. Profitability is volatile through 2024. The Bloomberg consensus forecast is more sanguine, though. Amid all that earnings volatility, dividends are seen as holding about steady over the next two-plus years. Meanwhile, Tronox’s EV/EBITDA multiple is modest while it generates big free cash flow. Overall, I like the valuation here despite bottom-line uncertainty – the free cash flow metric is often a better gauge of true profitability. Finally, Seeking Alpha rates the stock with a solid A- valuation. Tronox: Earnings, Valuation, Dividend Forecasts   BofA Global Research Looking ahead, data from corporate event provider Wall Street Horizon show an unconfirmed Q4 2022 earnings date of Wednesday, February 15 AMC. Before that, there is an upcoming dividend pay date of Friday, December 16. Corporate Event Calendar   Wall Street Horizon The Options Angle Tronox has a poor earnings beat rate history and an even worse post-earnings stock price reaction trend. That was seen starkly in its most recent Q3 report issued on October 27. According to Option Research & Technology Services (ORATS), the company reported $0.69 of per-share profits, below the consensus forecast of $0.75. The stock then fell 4.5%, smaller than the implied move in the options market of 7.5%. ORATS shows an expected EPS figure of $0.22 at its next earnings date in February, a steep year-on-year drop. Tronox: Weak Earnings History, EPS Loss Expected for Q4   ORATS The Technical Take TROX shares have surged lately despite that weak earnings report. A revival in the China markets has been a big boost to the stock. There are interesting technical developments here. First, notice how the stock surged above its down-trending 50-day moving average, but still remains solidly below the downward-sloping 200-day moving average.  The move is bullish, however, as the RSI momentum indicator popped above the key 60 level which had been resistance. It’s thought that momentum often turns before price, so this could be a harbinger of higher prices ahead. After a bullish double-bottom reversal pattern that formed in September and November, I think the stock has legs to near $16 in the short term. There’s the risk that the $14.50 to $15 area is resistance, though. Overall, the technical picture is mixed with such limited upside. TROX: Shares Encounter Some Resistance After A Double-Bottom   Stockcharts.com The Bottom Line  I like Tronox’s valuation here, and there are some positive technical signs. Long-term investors can likely own this one as a China re-opening play given its modest valuation and solid yield. Short-term traders might not like the risk/reward, but a break above the 200-day would be quite bullish. ",
