To explain her analysis, he examined the daily chart of the S&P 500.Inskip believes the market's gains from mid-October through the end of last week was a bear market rally – in other words, a temporary bounce in a larger downward trend, he said.He also reminded investors that the market is at the mercy of the Fed's interest rate increases, and the central bank's inflation strategy is beholden to the labor market.When November's hotter-than-expected labor report was released on Dec. 2, the S&P failed to jump two key ceilings of resistance.\"Inskip thinks we went right back into bear market mode,\" Cramer said. \"The S&P can still escape from this new trajectory, but she won't have much confidence in a bounce unless we blow through last Friday's levels.\"For more analysis, watch Cramer's full explanation below.Jim Cramer's Guide to InvestingClick here to download Jim Cramer's Guide to Investing at no cost to help you build long-term wealth and invest smarter.",
