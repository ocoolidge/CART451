		"content": "NEW DELHI: Defying the subdued trend in the domestic equity market, the Nifty PSU Bank index was the only green mark in a sea of red on Friday.  was the top gainer in the pack and rallied up to 11% to hit a fresh 52-week high at Rs 25.60.\n\nOther top gainers among PSU bank stocks included , Central ,  and , which rallied up to 5%.\n\nOn the back of this rally, the Nifty PSU Bank index rallied 2.4% to hit a new 52-week high of 3,883.95 even as the Nifty Bank index was trading lower.\n\n\nWhat's leading the upside?PSU bank stocks have been running ahead of its private sector peers amid improvements in asset quality, corporate loan book and operating performance.\nGiving the ongoing rally more firepower today is a government notification issued on Thursday that increased the maximum tenure of CEO and MD of public sector banks to 10 years from 5 years earlier. The move will help PSU lenders retain talent.\n\n\"A whole-time director, including the managing director, shall devote his whole time to the affairs of the nationalised bank and shall hold office for such a initial term not exceeding five years and extendable up to a total period, including the initial term, not exceeding 10 years, as the central government may, after consultation with the Reserve Bank, specify and shall be eligible for re-appointment,\" the notification read.\n\nPresently, many whole-time directors of PSU banks entered the board at a young age. The amendment would benefit them.\n\nIn the meantime, global brokerage BofA Securities has also issued a report saying that the turnaround in PSU bank stocks has legs beyond the largest lender . It expects the valuation discount between PSU banks and private sector banks to narrow further.\n\n\"Indian PSBs have been on the path of normalisation over the past few years, and it all came together in Q2, to deliver the best RoA in the past eight years. PSB's loan/PPOP growth was almost at par with private banks,\" BofA analyst Anand Swaminathan said, adding that the most comforting factor was the broad-based improvement in asset quality metrics.\n\n\n(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.
