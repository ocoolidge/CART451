Earlier this month, those gains began to reverse, as some investors seemed to decide to take profits from the sector’s top year-to-date performers. Despite those jitters, however, there is still opportunity in the healthcare sector.\n\n In an effort to identify the healthcare stocks that Wall Street analysts believe have the most room to grow, we screened the \n\n          \n            Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund\n (ticker: XLV), an exchange-traded fund that tracks larger healthcare stocks, for the stocks that trade the farthest below their average analyst price targets, as calculated by FactSet. The XLV is down 5.4% this year as of Monday’s close, its constituents split rather cleanly between stocks that are trailing the \n\n        \n          \n            S&P 500\n          \n so far this year, and stocks that are beating the S&P 500. We limited our screen to larger-cap names with market values of more than $20 billion. To ensure that the mean target prices represented a robust range of opinions, we also limited our screen to companies for which FactSet’s average included the estimates of at least 10 analysts. These target prices are just guesses; what’s more, they can mean different things to different analysts. Still, the average target price gives investors a sense of where Wall Street, by and large, thinks a stock could be going. The stocks that passed the screen represent not the year’s healthcare highfliers, but the stocks in the sector that have largely underperformed the S&P 500, which is down more than 15% this year through Monday.\n\n        Company / TickerRecent priceMean target priceImplied potential upsideYTD changeZoetis / ZTS$146.45$212.8045.3%-40.0%Edwards Lifesciences / EW$73.51$92.5125.8%-43.3Centene / CNC$82.04$101.2123.4%-0.4Medtronic / MDT$82.90$101.3822.3%-19.9CVS Health / CVS$97.17$116.7420.1%-5.8Baxter International / BAX$53.68$64.0019.2%-37.5 Source: Factset \n They include the animal-health firm \n\n        \n          \n            Zoetis \n          \n(ZTS), down 40% this year, which trades at a 45% discount to its mean target price of $212.80. \n\n        \n          \n            Zoetis\n          \n shares climbed sharply throughout the pandemic, jumping more than 80% between the end of 2019 and the end of 2021. This year, the stock has given away a good chunk of those gains. In a note out early in November, William Blair analyst Brandon Vazquez wrote that the company sees a strong demand for pets, despite the broader economic environment. “Despite noise in the quarter, management was clear that there has not been a slowdown in companion animal demand, and it expects this segment can remain resilient even in difficult macroeconomic conditions,” Vazquez wrote. Another stock that passed the screen was \n\n        \n          \n            Edwards Lifesciences\n          \n (EW), which makes heart valves, among other products. Its shares have fallen 43% this year. The stock has an average analyst target price of $92.51, about 26% above its recent price of $73.51. Edwards shares fell 15.4% in a single day in late October, after the company reported earnings that included disappointing sales results for its transcatheter aortic valve replacement device. Since then, the company has bought back shares. The health insurer \n\n        \n          \n            Centene \n          \n(CNC), down 0.4% this year, also passed the screen; its stock trades about 23% below its mean target price. So did \n\n        \n          \n            Medtronic \n          \n(MDT), the medical device firm; is shares have tumbled about 20% this year, and trade 22% below the mean target price. \n\n        \n          \n            Baxter International \n          \n(BAX), which sells dialysis machines and other devices to treat kidney conditions, among other products, is down about 38% this year. The stock trades at some 19% below its mean target price of $64. Write to Josh Nathan-Kazis at josh.nathan-kazis@barrons.com \n\n\n\n",
