Friday’s strong payrolls data complicate the matter—wage growth is still rising at a 5% clip—but doesn’t change the fact that after peaking at 9% in June, the consumer price index slipped to 7.8% in October and is expected to fall to 7.3% in November. That reading is due Dec. 13, one day before the Fed announces its next monetary-policy decision. ",
