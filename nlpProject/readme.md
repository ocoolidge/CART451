NLP excercise

I made two programs.  The first takes a dataset of company names and generates fictional company names.  
It takes a random syllable from the original dataset and combines them into one nonsense string a few syllables long.  Most of these end up being
total gibberish which is why I made a second version.  This verson takes three random full words from the original dataset and combines them into
one fictional company, some of which seem like they could actually exist.  I am still working on a visualization, forgive me Sabine!

When you run index.js, both programs will run and place their outputs in the directory, 'data', as text files: generated.txt and generated2.txt.
