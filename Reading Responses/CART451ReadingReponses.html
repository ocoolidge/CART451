<h2>Week One Reading Response</h2>

<p>
I love video games but I don't want to make them.  Pineapple is my favourite fruit.  Even though when you eat it, it eats you...  
But I love coffee even more&mdash;there’s something about Tim Horton's coffee though that gives it an extra punch.  We don't have anything like it
state-side that I can think of.  Also, as you know, I took two years off school, and what did I do with all that time? Played a lot of video-games 
and started smoking.  Its not half-bad though (the video-games are the good part) because since moving back to Canada I've noticed that cigarettes
are about half as potent, which means they're better for you right?  As long as I don't smoke twice as many...  I'm obsessed with cryptocurrency
and markets right now.  My favourite movie the the big short (I still support the occupy wall street movement though). Something about the hive-minded collective intelligence of markets and how they react to world events as well as 
interact with each other is fascinating to me.  And while their fluctuations seem nonsensical in the moment, the movements always have a logic 
in retrospect.  Except for crypto... that **** makes no sense at all.  People like to say that when you own cryptocurrency you own a finite amount
of nothing.  I wish Github would allow scripting on their repos so I could embed some real time crypto prices in this reading response because the market cap of Bitcoin
is currently at 384 BILLION US dollars.  And the total cryptocurrency market cap (price of all crypto coins summed together) is 960 Billion-almost a whole
trillion dollars.  I hope this topic isn't really boring.  Please let me know if it is because I think I want my project to involve the collective 
intelligence of markets using real time data.  I can't think of dataset that is available in real time which is more relevant to more people's lives than markets.  
Other then the weather.

<h3>The Rise of Crowdsourcing</h3>
<p>
Wikipedia is a croudsourcing platform that completely obscures the authors just as photography crowdsourcing platforms obscure the artists.
The obsscurity takes place not only becuase the author/photographer is not credited, or at least the credit aren't easily viewed, but more 
so because they become part of a massive database that contains a huge spectrum of content that may be almost exactly the same or may be
completey different.  The content written or created by an individual becomes inseperable from the group of content that it is a part of, and like-wise 
the authors and artists become part of a group and not individualized.  Furhtermore, the viewers don't even get a real sense that what they are viewing is 
was even created by a person at all.

<h3>Let me into your home: artist Lauren McCarthy on becoming Alexa for a day</h3>
<p>
Lauren Mcarthy states that she is almost jealous of the role that Alexa has in peolpe's every day lives.  Seeming as though 
Alexa replaces a position that normal human beings used to fill before technology took over it.  My question is what kinds of emotional fullfilment
are replaced and therefore unfulfilled due to technology in this post modern technological age?  And where do people go for the 
fullfilment of this emotion now?  Services like alexa occupy an intimate part of peoples lives, but as Lauren notices, those who
program these services were taught that "soial skills are less important then knowing how to program."  So it is those who
do not know how to fulfill this intimate part of peoples lives who it turns out are specifically allocated to occupy it.

<h3>If Then from: Mirror Stage, Between Computability and Its Opposite. Holo 3, 2022. Edited By Nora N.Khan</h3>
<p>
    MIMI ỌNỤỌHA writes about the real world usefulness of computer logic such as the if/then statement.
    She explains it, in its current usages to be a tool for defining logical relationships between events.  So if it is recorded
    that one event takes place, and there are other events connected to that event with if/then statements, then the likelihood 
    of those events can be determined.  This definition of causal relationships becomes a tool of prediciton.  If one event or combination of events is known to cause
    another event or combination events with a degree of probability, then outcomes can be prepared for before they happen.  OR, possibly more importantly, certain outcomes can be
    induced through the active manipulaiton of current events.  MIMI ỌNỤỌHA continues to deconstruct if/then logic by explaining how her native Nigerian, Igbo people are a culture
    that emphasizes continued change instead of the fixed logical relationships that are more hospitibal to computational logic.

<h3>INTERPERSONAL DATA</h3>
<p>
    Sheldrake points out an important problem with how data is collected and interpreted.  While humans and societal structures are fluid and ill defined
    as discrete entities, personal data is still collected as if this is not the case.  This is the problem wit definng a type of data as personal.  Things like
    bank accounts and their transactions can have their data collected and this data is stored as data refering to A person.  The one who owns the account.
    When in reality, this data is interpersonal.  It is a transaction between or among people or organizations.  This way of interpreting data severly limits 
    the insights that can be obtained.  Sheldrake then considers data as property.  Some say data is the new oil.  But the same data can be consumed and used 
    by different people unlike oil.  It has inherenty democratic properties which could lend it to sharing.  Also, personal data can now be sold by its person.

<h3>Refik Anadol</h3>
<p>
Before Refik Anadol started making machine learning models to generate data representations of various kinds of natural and man made environments or objects and projecting them onto famous pieces of of architecture, he was interested in more classical mediums like architecture and photography.  But his interest coding, data, and technology both artistically and culturally led him to explore new media.  Data as a material, architecture as a canvas, and technology as something that raises existential questions for humanity.  Like what does it mean when machines and humans collide?

<h3>From Abstraction to Realism and Back</h3>
<p>
Marcin explains what it was like to make procedurally generated visual art.  He breaks down the subject into basic mathematical objects like lines, cubes, torus’, etc.  and then combines these many entities together in a mathematical way.  These are called parametric systems.  In computer graphics, parametric systems are algorithms that are both machine readable and human recognizable once compiled.  Marcin then explains his data artwork.  Work that connects real world data to parametric computer graphics systems to create time based data visualizations.
