<h2>Week One Reading Response</h2>

<p>
I love video games but I don't want to make them.  Pineapple is my favorite fruit.  Even though when you eat it, it eats you...  
But I love coffee even more&mdash;theres something about Tim Horton's coffee though that gives it an extra punch.  We don't have anything like it
state-side that I can think of.  Also, as you know, I took two years off school, and what did I do with all that time? Played a lot of videogames 
and started smoking.  Its not half-bad though (the videogames are the good part) because since moving back to Canada I've noticed that cigarettes
are about half as potent, which means they're better for you right?  As long as I don't smoke twice as many...  I'm obsessed with cryptocurrency
and markets right now.  My favorite movie the the big short (I still support the occupy wall street movement though). Something about the hive-minded collective intelligence of markets and how they react to world events as well as 
interact with each other is fascinating to me.  And while their fluctuations seem nonsensicle in the moment, the movements always have a logic 
in retrospect.  Exept for crypto... that **** makes no sense at all.  People like to say that when you own cryptocurrency you own a finite amount
of nothing.  I wish github would allow scripting on their repos so I could embed some real time crypto prices in this reading response because the market cap of Bitcoin
is currently at 384 BILLION US dollars.  And the total cryptocurrency market cap (price of all crypto coins summed together) is 960 Billion-almost a whole
trillion dollars.  I hope this topic isn't really boring.  Please let me know if it is becasue I think I want my project to involve the collective 
intelligence of markets using real time data.  I can't think of dataset that is available in real time which is more relevent to more people's lives than markets.  
Other then the weather.
